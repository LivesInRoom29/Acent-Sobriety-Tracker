## Description

**Ascent is a sobriety tool** that helps members track their daily mood & thoughts as well as various lengths of sobriety. In a time where more and more people are living sober lifestyles, this app caters to those who are seeking to track continuous time as well as discontinuous time.

For many, sobriety is nonlinear, and to think of it as such, can be detrimental to long-term growth. With Ascent, members are able to check in with themselves daily and track, not only their length of continuous and discontinuous sobriety, but also their daily thoughts and mood.

By being able to reflect on daily thoughts, moods, and sobriety, Ascent seeks to provide support to each member as they navigate their sobriety during a time of limited socialization.
